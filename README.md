# Revisiting JS

> Before starting my new internship at Oracle, I would like to revisit key JS concepts. Mostly those closely related to the language such as protocols, object destructure and closures.

Some of the key concepts to visit are as follows: 

- Closures
- Event Loops
- Callback Functions
- Async/Await and Promises
- Functional Programming
- High-Order functions
- Generators
- Hoisting
- IIFEs
- Memoization
- Currying
