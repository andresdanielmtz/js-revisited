# Revisiting JS

> Before starting my new internship at Oracle, I would like to revisit key JS concepts. Mostly those closely related to the language such as protocols, object destructure and closures.

Some of the key concepts to visit are as follows:

- Prototypes
- Closures
- Event Loops
- Callback Functions
- Async/Await and Promises
- Functional Programming
- High-Order functions
- Generators
- Hoisting
- IIFEs
- Memoization
- Currying

Most (if not all) concepts are visited through [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development).

## How to run the project

As it is composed of various node files. Feel free to use `node <filename>` for any file you might want to run. These features are mostly ES5-ES6 compatible.
